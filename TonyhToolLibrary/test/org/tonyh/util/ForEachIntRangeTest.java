A custom tool library

With this knowledge, you can now create your own libraries
of tools to reduce or eliminate duplicate code. Consider, 
for example, the alias weï¿½ve been using for System.out.println( ), 
to reduce typing. This can be part of a class called Print 
so that you end up with a readable static import:


The foreach syntax won't work unless you want to create an array of first.
To simply this tas, Mr Eckel created a method called range() that automatically
generates the appropiate array. The intent is for range() to be used as a
"static" import.  p120 in book
